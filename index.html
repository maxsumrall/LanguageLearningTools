        <h3>Print these out!</h3>

<p>Learning a new language is difficult. Not becasue some people are inheriently bad at it, but because the depth of information you need to learn is enormous. So to manage, you need daily practice. No matter if you are living in a country that speaks your desired language, if you plan on moving, or if you just want to know the language, it would be great to have notes and charts posted around your room to reference every day. I wanted something like this when I was in Sweden, but I couldn't find it. Then I saw Tim Ferris's blog post about learning a language, and how he used a word frequency chart and a few core sentences to get going with learning a language. </p>


<p>So far there's Dutch and Swedish, but I'd love to expand out to many more languages. Please FIND ERRORS in these charts, make improvements, and add new languages, and even completly redesign them! I'm not an artist. </p>

<h3>Download:</h3>

<p>If you want to whole set for all languages, just click the "ZIP" link in the top right corner of this page. Otherwise you can have a look at the repo on GitHub and find exactly what you want.</p>
